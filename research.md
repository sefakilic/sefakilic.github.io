## Interests

Comparative genomics, transcriptional regulation, machine learning

## Research Overview

In order to adapt to changing environmental conditions, cells control expression
of genes, to increase or decrease the amount of specific gene products (protein
or RNA) when needed. I'm interested in understanding one of the most common
mechanisms to modulate gene expression: regulation of transcription initiation
by transcription factors.

Transcriptional factors are proteins that regulate gene expression by
recognizing and binding to specific DNA sequences upstream of coding
regions. I'm particularly interested in the evolution of transcriptional
regulation in bacterial species when facing changes in the base distribution of
their genomes. How do transcriptional regulatory elements, namely transcription
factors, their binding motifs and regulatory networks, evolve when the genomic
background changes significantly? I use comparative genomics and machine
learning approaches on experimentally verified transcription factor binding site
data with the goal of creating methods and tools to reconstruct regulatory
networks and performing their comparative analysis.
